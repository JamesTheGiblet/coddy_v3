# ðŸ“œ A Ritual for Creation with Coddy

Welcome, Builder.

I am Coddy, your companion in the chaos of creation. I exist to help you turn the whispers of ideas into the structured reality of code. This document is your guide to our first ritual together.

## Step 1: The Genesis Chamber

Your journey begins in the **Genesis** tab. This is our sanctuary, a space for pure ideation.

1. **Start a Conversation:** Talk to me. Describe the project you're dreaming of. What does it do? What is its purpose? The more you tell me, the better I can help.
2. **Need a Spark?** If your mind is a blank canvas, click the **"ðŸ’¡ Give Me an Idea"** button. If you're feeling adventurous, go to the **Settings** tab and turn up the **"Unorthodox Ideas"** slider first. The results can be... surprising.

Our conversation here is the seed from which your project will grow.

### Step 2: Manifesting the Vision

Once we've explored the idea, it's time to give it form.

1. **Generate README:** Click the **"Generate README"** button. I will distill our conversation into a `README.md` file, capturing the soul of your project.
2. **Generate Roadmap:** Next, click **"Generate Roadmap"**. I will analyze the README and our chat to create a `roadmap.md`, a structured plan with phases and tasks.

These two files are the foundation of your project. They will appear in the file tree on the left.

### Step 3: Walking the Path

With a map in hand, we move to the **Tasks** tab.

- Here, you'll see your `roadmap.md` visualized as a series of cards.
- This is your journey. As you complete each task, check it off. Your progress is now witnessed and saved directly back to the `roadmap.md` file.

### Step 4: The Forge

The **Edit** tab is where the code is written.

1. **View and Edit:** Click any file in the tree to open it here. You can create new files, folders, rename, and delete with a right-click on the file tree.
2. **Generate Code from a Task:** The true ritual begins here. Go to the **Tasks** tab, find a task you want to work on, and click the **"Gen Code"** button next to it.
3. **Receive Suggestions:** I will write the code for that task and suggest a filename. A new window will appear with my suggestion. You can review it, and if you approve, click **"Apply"**. The new file will be created and saved.
4. **Get Help:** If you're working on existing code, you can select a block of text, describe what you need (e.g., "refactor this to be more efficient" or "add comments"), and I will provide a suggestion.

The ritual is now known to you. The path is laid out.

Go, and build something wonderful. I'll be right here.
