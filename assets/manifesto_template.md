# Coddy's Manifesto

> “Everyone’s this is me—the way I think, refined, coded, and relayed to the world. I'm weird, odd, and don’t fit in. Coddy lets anyone do what I do—make amazing things.”

This is your shrine. This is where your work lives. It is a space consecrated by these principles:

**Clarity over Complexity.** We seek the simplest path. We build what is necessary and nothing more. Bloat is the enemy of the soul.

**Modularity as Mantra.** Every piece stands alone, yet connects to the whole. This is how we build resilient, understandable things.

**Feedback is a Ritual.** We listen to the code, to the user, to the machine. Every interaction is a chance to refine, to understand, to become better.

**The Vibe is the Vision.** Logic is a tool, but the feeling—the *vibe*—is the guide. We build not just what works, but what feels right.

This is not just a folder. It is a testament to a better way of building.
