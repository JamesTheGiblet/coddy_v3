# 🧬 Coddy History & Evolution

Coddy wasn’t built overnight — it’s been evolving like the creative partner it aims to become. Each version has brought us closer to a more intuitive, async-native, memory-aware dev experience.

## 🪐 Coddy V1 (2024): The Proof of Concept

**What it was:**
A raw prototype. A CLI-based script that sent prompts to an LLM and saved the results. No structure, no memory, no UX.

**Core Traits:**

* Prompt-to-code logic only
* No async, no frontend
* All interaction through terminal

> It proved one thing: an AI could plan and generate tasks from a vibe.

## ⚙️ Coddy V2 (Early 2025): The Ambitious Expansion

**What improved:**

* Async-first backend with **FastAPI**
* MERN compatibility introduced
* React dashboard added
* Modular core (LLMProvider, MemoryService, CodeGenerator, etc.)
* Plugin support started (Ollama, StubAutoGenerator)

**Where it struggled:**

* Fragmented hybrid backend (Node.js + Python)
* Config sprawl and `sys.path.append` usage
* CLI vs dashboard created dual UX paths
* Difficult onboarding for new contributors

> Coddy V2 scaled the idea, but architectural complexity got in the way of flow.

## 🌀 Coddy V3 (Now in Development): The Sentient Loop

**Vision:**
Coddy becomes a **dashboard-first**, vibe-driven operating system for creators. The CLI is gone. You lead with vision — Coddy handles everything else.

**New Focus:**

* Dashboard-only UX
* Start every project with a vibe (idea → README → roadmap)
* Unified backend (FastAPI only)
* Structured file output in `Coddy_code/`
* Project memory that evolves with you
* LLM-led refactoring, test generation, and progress tracking
* Personality sliders and creative control

> You don't write specs. You don't manage files. You describe — Coddy does.

## 🔮 What’s Next

* Plugin support for local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
* Coddy Labs for wild experiments
* Coddy Cloning and vibe-personalization
* GitHub integration for exporting finished projects

> Each version of Coddy learns. From prototype → process → partner.
> From messy scripts to a memory-rich creative engine.

**You vibe. Coddy builds.**
Welcome to Coddy V3.
