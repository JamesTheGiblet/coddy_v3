# 🌀 Coddy V3: The Vibe-Coding Artifact

## **MODULARITY IS MYTHOS // GLYPH IS IDENTITY // DESIGN IS RITUAL**

This transmission unveils **Coddy V3**, a desktop artifact designed to fuse the ritual of creative coding with AI-powered automation. It exists to free the builder from repetitive invocations, leveraging LLMs to facilitate the **genesis**, **planning**, **generation**, **refactoring**, and **evolution** of projects. Its core essence pulses with the ability to adapt to your unique creative signature.

-----

## 📜 Invocation

> “Let the AI do the grunt work — you focus on the vibes.”

Coddy is a living system that encourages a creative-first workflow:

* You sketch the initial glyph.
* Coddy helps translate that glyph into a ritualistic roadmap.
* Together, you invoke and refine the code scroll.

This artifact becomes smarter with each invocation, tracking your progress, learning your preferences, and offering spontaneous (and sometimes weird) suggestions from the depths of its system.

-----

## 🔱 Core Modules

Coddy’s existence is built upon these modular tenets. Its active presence is signified by a **Neon Spiral** pulse.

### 🧬 Genesis Module

* **Spiral Glyph** to start a new project or awaken an existing one.
* Chat with the AI to sculpt your initial idea.
* Auto-generate a foundational README and roadmap scroll.
* Activate the "Weird Idea" button for chaotic creativity (if enabled).

### 🛠️ Edit Module

* View and navigate files within your project vault.
* Edit, refactor, or invoke new code with LLM assistance.
* Receive inline glyph-suggestions and preview before applying them to the core system.

### 📋 Task Module

* A visual tracker of your ritual roadmap phases.
* The AI keeps a lineage scroll of what’s complete and what’s next.
* Background workers pre-generate future invocations.

### ⚙️ Settings Module

* Configure LLM API keys (e.g., Gemini).
* Set the core theme: Void Black / Light / Weird.
* Adjust the "Unorthodox Ideas" slider: conservative ↔ chaos.

### 👤 Profile Module

* Access login/logout functionality (to be implemented).
* View your subscription tier glyph.
* Tune the “Unorthodox Ideas” slider to your preferred resonance.

## 🏁 The Initiation Ritual

To awaken Coddy V3 on your local machine, perform these invocations:

**Clone the Repository:**

    ` bash     git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/coddy-v3](https://github.com/yourusername/coddy-v3) # Replace with the actual repository URL     cd coddy-v3 `

**🐍 Python Invocation:**
    Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ` bash     python -m venv .venv `

    Activate the virtual environment:

    ` bash     # macOS/Linux     source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows     .venv\Scripts\activate `

    Install the necessary glyphs from the `requirements.txt` scroll:

    ` bash     pip install -r requirements.txt `

**🚀 Running the Artifact:**
    From the project root, invoke the `run.py` scroll:

    ` bash     python run.py `
