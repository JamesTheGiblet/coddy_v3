Here's the updated `README.md` for Coddy V3, reflecting the changes in its setup and technologies:

```markdown
# 📦 Coddy V3

**Coddy V3** is your vibe-coding companion — a desktop application that fuses creative coding with AI-powered automation. Designed to free developers from repetitive tasks, Coddy leverages LLMs to help you **brainstorm**, **plan**, **generate**, **refactor**, and **evolve** projects — all while adapting to your unique coding style.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

> "Let the AI do the grunt work — you focus on the vibes."

Coddy encourages a creative-first workflow:

* You sketch the idea
* Coddy helps turn that idea into a roadmap
* Together, you generate and refine the code

Coddy gets smarter as you use it — tracking progress, learning your preferences, and offering spontaneous (and sometimes weird) suggestions.

---

## 💻 Local-First Installable App

* Built with **Tkinter** (GUI Framework) and **Python** (Core Logic)
* Cross-platform: Windows, macOS, Linux
* Fast, lightweight, and modular
* Fully local session data & settings storage

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧬 Genesis Tab

* Start a new project or load existing one
* Chat with the AI to shape your idea
* Auto-generate README and roadmap
* "Weird Idea" button for chaotic creativity (if enabled)

### 🛠️ Edit Tab

* View files in your project
* Edit, refactor, or generate code with LLM help
* Inline suggestions and preview before applying

### 📋 Tasks Tab

* Visual tracker of roadmap phases and tasks
* AI keeps track of what's done, what’s next
* Background worker pre-generates future steps

### ⚙️ Settings Tab

* Configure LLM API keys (e.g., Gemini)
* Set theme: Light / Dark / Weird
* Adjust prompt retry count and model behavior

### 👤 Profile Menu

* Access login/logout (future feature)
* See subscription tier
* Adjust “Unorthodox Ideas” slider: conservative ↔ chaos

## 🧪 Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Projects | Features Access | Weird Mode | AI Tracking |
| :--- | :------- | :-------------- | :--------- | :---------- |
| Free | 1 | Core Only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Pro | Unlimited | Full | ✅ | ✅ |
| Team | Unlimited | Collaboration, Sync | ✅ | ✅ |

Features are not API-limited — they are **functionality-limited** based on tier.

## 🔥 Adaptive AI Engine

Coddy learns your intent and adjusts accordingly:

* Learns from your prompts, edits, and style
* Tailors LLM output to your tone, habits, project structure
* Adjusts roadmap granularity, idea types, and UX flow

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.11+** (application logic)
* **Tkinter** (GUI Framework)
* **google-generativeai** (for AI interactions)
* **SQLite / JSON** (local data storage)
* **python-dotenv** (for environment variable management)

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get Coddy V3 up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/coddy-v3](https://github.com/yourusername/coddy-v3) # Replace with the actual repository URL
    cd coddy-v3
    ```

2.  **🐍 Python Setup:**
    Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:
    * On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    Install Python dependencies. If you have a `requirements.txt` file, use:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Otherwise, ensure you have these core libraries installed:
    ```bash
    pip install google-generativeai python-dotenv
    ```
    *Tkinter is typically included with Python installations.*

3.  **🚀 Running the Application:**
    From the project root directory, execute the main application script:

    ```bash
    python coddy_core/app.py
    ```

## 🚀 Status

Coddy V3 is under active development.
The current roadmap includes:

* Genesis Tab
* Roadmap generator
* File system interaction
* AI refactor engine
* Local session memory and user adaptation
