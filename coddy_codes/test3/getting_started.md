# Welcome to Coddy!

This is your first project. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## The Coddy Workflow

Coddy is designed to help you go from idea to code, fast. Here's the typical flow:

### 1. 🌱 Genesis Tab
This is where your project is born. Use the chat to brainstorm your idea. Once it's solid, ask Coddy to **Generate README** or **Generate Roadmap**.

### 2. ✅ Tasks Tab
Once you have a `roadmap.md`, this tab becomes your interactive project plan. Check off tasks as you complete them.

### 3. ✍️ Edit Tab
This is your AI-assisted coding environment. Click on any file in the "Project Files" tree to open it. Use the AI Task box to get suggestions, refactor code, and more.

### 4. ⚙️ Settings Tab
Configure Coddy to your liking. Set your Gemini API key, change the theme, and manage preferences.

Happy coding!
