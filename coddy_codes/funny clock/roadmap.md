# Roadmap: Funny Clock for Kids

**I. Core Project Definition**

1. **Project Name:** Funny Clock for Kids
2. **Brief Description/Purpose:** To create a fun and engaging desktop clock application for elementary school-aged children (ages 6-12) featuring quirky fonts and a user-friendly timer.
3. **Target Audience:** Elementary school children (ages 6-12), primarily focusing on Windows operating systems.


**II. Core Features / MVP Scope**

1. **Time Display with Quirky Fonts:**
    *   Milestone 1: Research and select 3-5 suitable free/open-source fonts with a playful aesthetic.
    *   Milestone 2: Implement font selection within the application (potentially allowing a user to choose between pre-selected fonts).
    *   Milestone 3:  Ensure clear and legible display of time, even with unconventional fonts.  Consider different font sizes for different screen resolutions.
    *   Milestone 4:  Thorough testing to ensure readability and usability for the target age group.

2. **Simple Countdown Timer:**
    *   Milestone 1: Design the user interface (UI) for the timer, ensuring it's intuitive and easy for children to use. Include visual indicators (e.g., progress bar).
    *   Milestone 2: Implement timer functionality with start, stop, and reset buttons.
    *   Milestone 3: Add a clear and audible alert upon timer completion (consider options for volume control).
    *   Milestone 4: Thorough testing of timer functionality and user experience.


**III. Tech Stack**

1. **Primary Language/Platform:** Python
2. **GUI Framework:** PyQt
3. **Key Libraries/Components:**  `time`,  `datetime`, potential sound library (e.g., `playsound`), font rendering libraries as needed.
4. **Data Storage:** No persistent data storage needed for MVP.


**IV. Future Considerations / Enhancements**

1. **Multiple Clock Faces:** Implement a system to allow users to choose from a variety of pre-designed clock faces, each with different font styles and color themes.
2. **Interactive Elements:** Add simple interactive elements, like animations or small games integrated into the clock design.
3. **Alarm Functionality:**  Extend the timer functionality to include an alarm function with customizable alarm sounds.
4. **Cross-Platform Support:** Expand support beyond Windows to include macOS and potentially Linux.
5. **Customization Options:** Allow users to adjust font sizes, colors, and other visual aspects of the clock.


**V. Project Management & Operational Aspects**

1. **Contribution Guidelines:**  (To be defined upon project initiation, likely using a standard open-source contribution model if open-sourced).
2. **Licensing:** (To be defined upon project initiation, likely using a permissive open-source license such as MIT or similar).


**VI. Implicit Understandings and Assumptions**

*   Assumes basic familiarity with Python and PyQt.
*   Assumes access to necessary software and hardware for development and testing.
*   Assumes the availability of suitable free/open-source fonts.
*   The project's success will be measured by usability testing with the target age group and feedback on ease of use and overall enjoyment.
